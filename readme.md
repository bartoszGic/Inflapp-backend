# InflApp Backend

This repository contains the backend code for the InflApp application. The backend is built using Node.js and Express, providing a RESTful API to manage articles related to inflation data. It handles CRUD operations for the articles, allowing the frontend to display, create, update, and delete records efficiently.

## Features

- RESTful API: Supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
- CORS Enabled: Ensures secure communication between frontend and backend.
- JSON-based: Uses JSON for data exchange, ensuring compatibility with modern web applications.
- Local and Production Ready: Configured to run both locally and in production environments (e.g., Vercel).

## How to Run Locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using 'npm install'.
3. Start the server with 'node index.js'.
4. Access the API at 'http://localhost:5555'.
